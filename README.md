# Random Dot Patterns

To generate some random dots with the default settings:
```bash
python randomdots.py
```
To load some random dots from a file:
```bash
python randomdots.py my_file.pkl
```

To understand how the code works, I have included highly descriptive comments in [```randomdots.py```](https://github.com/oliviaguest/random-dots/blob/master/random_dots.py).
Also running the following will return the docstring for creating, initialising, saving, etc., a random dot pattern:
```python
import randomdots
help(randomdots)
```
